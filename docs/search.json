    "text": "What is this?\nThis is not an exhaustive book featuring deep dives into the history or application of specific statistics concepts, ideas and methods. It is also not meant to be a textbook accompanying a university course - although I might use it in this way in the future.\nInstead, this is meant to be a collection of small texts and examples serving as primers on core statistical concepts, methods and workflows. The aim here is to present the basic ideas (as well as their execution in R) and explain the reasons behind these ideas, in order to give you a general understanding as to what is happening. I will also point you in the right direction if you want to dive deeper.\n\nAren’t there many resources like this already?\nYes, and no. Although a lot of books have been written about the core ideas behind statistical methods, and many web resources about the application of these methods in any given statistical program exist, these suffer from some major drawbacks:\n\nBooks are long and nobody wants to read anymore. I hope that my way of explaining stuff as concise as possible, as well as my way of writing will resonate in a way that many “dry” statistics textbooks simply can’t.\nWhile Andy Field’s (2012) is still a great book on the subject, it was published in 2012 and much of the code used is unfortunately wildly out-of-date. Don’t get me wrong, most of it will still work fine. However, better and more user-friendly ways to work in R have emerged since.\nAt the end of the day statistics is math, and math people love communicating via formulas and mathematical notations. I don’t know about you, but unfortunately my brain shuts off whenever I see more than two mathematical formulas in a text. Therefore, I will try to keep the mathematics to a minimum and instead focus on examples and comparisons to explain ideas.\nHow-To guides tend to focus mainly on the “how” of statistical methods and not on the “why” behind it. While they might make you an expert about anything a given R (Python, …) function may be able to do, you still won’t know when and how to use them - or why you might get certain weird results back. Also, nowadays LLMs can teach you the “how” part probably better than any website ever will.\nMost statistics websites are run by professional website owners. This is not meant as a dig at them - they can do whatever they want - but I personally hate seeing ads and cookie-popups when I just want to find out why my code won’t work. Therefore, you won’t find ads or cookie banners here, because I don’t care who you are. :)"

    "text": "The Core Structure\nThis also means that this isn’t necessarily designed to be read front-to-back. Instead, I would encourage you to jump to a specific subject whenever you encounter it, and work your way from there until the end of your issues.\nHowever, I have still organized the book into subsections that (in my view) link together logically connected subjects and methods, going from simple methods and concepts on towards more complex implementations. However, the sprawling nature of statistical methods and coding means that forcing everything into a linear progression would do more harm than good. Therefore, while you may encounter basic concepts in a given topic (like “Plotting Data” in the main topic “Descriptive Statistics”), you will also find expansions of these contexts in separate topics (in this case “Data Plotting in R”).\nTo emphasize this further, everything that centers on using R, and less on statistical methodology has been organized into it’s own part in the structure. While the numbered parts deal with statistics, part R focuses on using R and RStudio. I would encourage everyone who is not familiar with R (or certain packages I frequently use) to look at this part whenever you’re not sure what I’m doing or why I’m doing things in a certain way - you’ll hopefully find an explanation there.\n\nLast modified: 2023-08-22 15:39, R version 4.3.1\nSource data for this page can be found here.\n\n\n\n\nField, Andy P., Jeremy Miles, and Zoë Field. 2012.

Do these situations still haunt you in your dreams? It doesn’t have to be like that! Git is a type of version control for your machine, allowing you to manually set Checkpoints for your progress that you can restore at any time for the entire folder or individual files within it.\nGoing even further, GitHub is a online database where you can upload these checkpoints. While GitHub is the most popular repository, there are many others that build on Git or similar structures to offer version control of your files. Now you may ask yourself: “Why would I want to upload my personal projects to the internet?” Well, here are some of the arguments:"

While this can be very convenient, keep in mind that in this way version control only works with this client! Meaning that if you want to sync something not intended by the developers, you might be in for an annoying time.\nIf you want to go this way, there is a whole boatload of potential desktop clients to choose from. If you for example already use VS Code for other projects, there’s a Git integration built in and you’ll find plenty of resources online to set that up, as well as plenty of plugins to expand it. Going beyond VS Code, GitHub has it’s own desktop client that’s able to sync any folder on your device. However, the last time I used it, I found it to be very annoying and clunky. The better alternative in my view and the one I use pretty regularly is GitKraken. The Team behind GitKraken is also responsible for the VS Code GitLens extension if you want to upgrade its capabilities."

    "text": "Version 2: Git on your system and in RStudio\n\nStep 1: Installing Git\nAs mentioned previously, GitHub is only a web service for hosting you checkpoints and data. To communicate with GitHub, you can use a range of standardized commands and operations made available via a software called Git. Unfortunately (and this is the reason why desktop clients exist), Git is code-only and requires a Unix-terminal to function properly - which means Windows users have to jump through a few hoops when compared with everyone else.\n\nGit on Linux/Unix\nBased on your chosen distro, Git can easily be installed via package managers or built from source. For an installation overview for many of the more common distros see: https://git-scm.com/download/linux\n\n\nGit on MacOS\nIf you’re lucky, Git might already be installed on your machine from the get-go. To check if this is the case, simply open the terminal app and enter git --version. If a version number is displayed, git is installed on your machine - and if not, MacOS should ask you if it should install it now.\n\n\nGit on Windows\nWindows - unlike the other two options - does not have built-in Unix support, which means we also have to install a Unix terminal. Fortunately, Git comes with a built-in terminal (Git Bash) if you install it from the official website\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nGit will ask you during installation for a standard editor. In principle this choice shouldn’t matter, as that editor will only be used in case of errors, which you shouldn’t encounter when using Git through RStudio or desktop clients. Still, if you don’t know what you’re doing and have never heard of VI or VIM, it’s probably best to switch this to something like Nano or Notepad++ (if installed). All other installation steps can be left as default for normal use.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Git and RStudio\nAfter you install Git, RStudio should automatically detect it. To check, you can go to Tools -&gt; Global Options -&gt; GIT/SVN and see if it is listed there. If it isn’t listed there, you can manually add it by specifying the path: yourGitFolder/bin/git.exe. Restarting RStudio might also lead to a Git detection, especially if RStudio was opened during the Git installation process.\n\n\nStep 3: Configuring Git and GitHub\nAll the following steps can be done via the previously installed Git Bash terminal - however, this is (in my view) an unintuitive and error-prone process for casual users. Luckily, there is a way to configure Git in a more user-friendly way using R’s usethis package. After installing and loading usethis, you can open Git’s configuration directly using the edit_git_config command. Enter your name and the mail address of your GitHub account as follows:\n[user]\n    name = Your Name\n    email = github@mail-adress.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSide Note\n\n\n\nThe name you set here can be anything you like - however, keep in mind that it will appear whenever you upload something to GitHub from this device. You could for example give a name like Paul work laptop, to easily track which device made the changes.\n\n\nAfter this step, Git is ready to serve as a local version control. However, to sync your changes with GitHub, one more step of authentication is needed - after all, if it were only about name and mail address, anyone could commit changes in your name.\nLuckily, the usethis package can help us here once again: Running the function create_github_token() should open up the correct GitHub website to create your own so-called Personal Access Token. Here, you can also specify whether this token should only be active for a limited time (useful when working on other people’s machines) or what privileges this machine should have (touch this if you know what you’re doing, otherwise defaults should be fine). After completing this step, GitHub should present you with a token of the format ghp_....\nNote down this token somewhere, as you will never see it again once you close the site!\nTo set this token on your machine, go back to R and run the function gitcreds::gitcreds_set() (installed alongside usethis) and enter the token you just created. Theoretically, everything should be set up - you can check that yourself by running git_sitrep(). The big advantage of this is that Git is now globally configured and associated with your GitHub account, no matter what program you want to use on your machine - if it has Git or GitHub functionality, it should automatically detect your configurations.\nCongratulations! You should now (hopefully) have everything set up and ready to use version controlling and GitHub! In the next step, we’ll be looking at actually working with Git inside RStudio, as there is a lot of neat functionality built-in to take work off of you.\nIf you want to know more or take a deep dive on using R and Git - or if you encounter any problems that require a more thorough explanations - I recommend you have a look at https://happygitwithr.com/\n\nLast modified: 2023-08-24 10:38, R version 4.3.1\nSource data for this page can be found here."

    "text": "Starting a project\nTo have Git integration work from inside RStudio, it is strictly necessary to work inside an RStudio project rather than just a loose collection of code files scattered around your machine. This is because RStudio seems to treat the .Rproj file as an anchor point to build the file management around. While there are many ways to start a project, I want to highlight two different ways of doing things - although both boil down to the same method in the end.\nNow that you’ve opened your Git-synced project in RStudio, you might have already noticed something new: The Environment tab (usually top right) features a new tab simply labeled Git. When working with Git in RStudio, this tab is where all the magic happens - and everything that you otherwise would have to execute manually via the aforementioned Unix-terminal. Don’t be scared, but I will now show you a graphic visualizing the basic working steps in Git that I stole from Reddit:\nYou should already know many of the areas mentioned in this image, although maybe not by this name: The remote branch is the repo saved on GitHub, while the working branch is the file structure on your current machine. The other layers in between are what makes Git so powerful for version control (and so irritating in the beginning). Here’s how it works on a basic level:\nNow, if you’ve already made some changes to your new R project, you might notice that things start to appear inside the git-tab un RStudio. Based on the type of change, you should see a coloured symbol appear in the “Status” column: ?(New file), A(dded), M(odified), D(eleted) and R(enamed) will probably be the ones you’ll encounter most frequently. This window is RStudio’s pendant to the staging area I just mentioned - here, files are being prepared for a git synchronization. What the command git add does in the image above can be achieved here by clicking the check box:\nTo commit your selected files, you simply have to click the aptly named “Commit” button, leave an informative commit message as to what you did and why (so you know what happened when you look back in a few weeks/months/years) in the now open window, and then press “Commit” there as well.\nCongratulations! You now know how to use Git for version control! All that remains now is syncing your files with GitHub - something RStudio directly lets you know by complaining that your local branch is ahead of GitHub (here called origin/main) in it’s update history. To rectify this, simply press the green, upwards pointing arrow. In the opposite situation, where GitHub is further ahead than your local machine, RStudio would still complain, and you would pull by pressing the blue, downwards pointing arrow."

In this way, the project should immediately be usable, without having to worry about manually pushing or pulling files.

The core idea in this step is the same as before: We follow the instructions above to generate an (empty) repository and generate it locally as a new project. The trick with this approach is that you can now go ahead and - after opening the project’s folder in a file manager of your choice - simply copy all your old files into this new folder. RStudio’s Git integration will recognize these files as new to the project, and you will be able to work with them as if you had just created them inside the project."

    "text": "Branches: More control over your project\nWhen you start a new project, you end up with one linearly developing history of changes, usually called a main branch (or “master” if following older conventions). However, it might not always be a good idea to work inside this main branch. For example if you’re only testing features and you’re not yet sure if they make it into the final project (or if they are horribly unstable), it might not be a good idea to include them in your main code database where they might ruin stuff or at the very least fill up your change history. Another case would be if you wanted to try and compare multiple different approaches to the same problem - you can’t really have both in the same file at the same time usually, as they are exclusive.\nLuckily, Git’s designers have thought of this and introduced the concept of “branches”: versions of your code that “split off” from the main branch and can develop in differing directions, allowing you to try out all the wildest ideas without ruining your project. For a practical use case, as I’ve mentioned before, ths website updates automatically whenever I commit something to the underlying repository. Now, I don’t want this to happen any time I make and commit some minor change, which is why I actually commit to a different branch called “indev” - and once I’m satisfied with my progress, I simply carry over all my changes to the main branch in one fell swoop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSide Note\n\n\n\nEven if you’re not dealing with these kinds of issues, it is probably always best to work with a separate testing branch, and NEVER commit untested code directly to the main branch - who knows what you might break in the process …\n\n\nWhen working in R, I found it easiest to employ the following workflow for new branches:\n\ncommit all outstanding changes to the branch you want to branch off from\ncreate a new branch on GitHub\nPull in GitHub. Since you’re up-to-date, no files should be overwritten, but the new branch should be detected. You can now switch local branches inside the Git tab (where it says “main” in the image above), and all changes should automatically be attributed to this branch from now on."

In fact, if you’re looking to solve a specific problem, you might find that someone has already started working on it - or completed a somewhat similar project that just needs some slight tweaking for your use case. This is where forks come in.\nForks are basically just like branches, with the main difference being that you’re not creating a new branch inside the same repository, but instead creating a new repository based on someone else’s work. That way, you start out with all the work they’ve already committed and can then go on to tweak it to your liking. For a practical example, the engine underlying the Firefox web browser has almost 2.000 forks from users modifying security settings to their liking or building their own web browsers from the provided baseline (not an endorsement, just an example)."
